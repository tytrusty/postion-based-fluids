# imgui-opengl-glfw-cmake-demo

This is a demo project for [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with [opegl](https://www.opengl.org/), [glfw3](http://www.glfw.org/), [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/). 

The purpose of this project is to combine ImGui with glew and CMake. The original example is written with gl3w instead of glew. I personally preffers glew. As for CMake, I want to get used to it to build.

This project generates a stand alone demo app. Currently it is build only on Apple environment (only on Macs) but the build system and libraries are all crass-platform so it is possible to expand for build in Windows and Linux environment.

## A breaf explanation of ImGui

It's easy to use simple GUI library for C++. It suits for 3D pipeline enabled application. The easiest way is just copy and add libraries in your project. That's all.

The next citations are from it's [README](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

> dear imgui (AKA ImGui), is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies).
  
> ImGui is designed to enable fast iteration and empower programmers to create content creation tools and visualization/ debug tools (as opposed to UI for the average end-user). It favors simplicity and productivity toward this goal, and thus lacks certain features normally found in more high-level libraries.

## How to build this project

It is really easy to use ImGui. The easiest way is for adding its sources to your project. in this demo, I aimed to use CMake as a build tool in a case cooperating with other sources.

This project uses several libraries so you have to prepare these. If you've alreadly had them you can skip this instructions

### Mac

Install libraries:

```bash
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" # Install homebrew
$ brew update
$ brew install cmake # Install CMake
$ brew install glfw # Install glfw3
$ brew install glew # Install glew
``` 

Build and generate a stand alone app:

```bash
$ cd /to/project/root/
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Or you can build and run with [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

You'll find the app in the build directry.
